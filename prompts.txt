If you give ChatGPT the perfect prompt, you'll get a much more useful answer the very first time.

Most people use ChatGPT in beginner mode, and without knowing how to structure a prompt, it will never give you the ideal output.

Let me share 7 best practices when it comes to effective prompt engineering. Then I will give you the formula and show you real life examples.

1 - Be Specific: If you ask a vague question, you may get a vague answer. The more details you provide, the better the model can give you what you're looking for. Instead of "tell me about all dog breeds that exist,” ask "What are the different breeds of small dogs suitable for apartment living?"

2 - State Your Intent: If there's a specific purpose for your question, state it in the prompt. For example, instead of asking “explain quantum physics” you could say "I'm helping my fifth-grade son with his science homework. Could you explain quantum physics in a simple way?"

3 - Use Correct Spelling and Grammar: While the model can often interpret and correct spelling and grammar mistakes, providing clear and correct prompts helps ensure you get the best response.

4 - Direct the Output Format: If you want the answer in a specific format, state it in your question. For example, you could ask "Could you list the steps to bake a chocolate cake?" or "Could you explain the process of baking a chocolate cake in a paragraph?"

5 - Ask Follow-Up Questions: If the response wasn't what you expected or if you need more information, feel free to ask follow-up questions to clarify.

6 - Experiment with Different Phrasings: If you're not getting the response you want, try asking the question in a different way. The model might understand one phrasing better than another.

7 - Prompt for Fact-Checking: If you're looking for reliable information, you can ask the model to provide sources or to fact-check information. For example, "Can you fact-check this statement: The tallest mountain in the world is Mount Everest?"


Here is the formula for a perfect prompt.
[Context] + [Specific Information] + [Intent/Goal] + [Response Format (if needed)] = Perfect Prompt


Let me share two different examples with you and fill in the formula.

Context: "I'm a beginner cook"
Specific Information: "trying to make Italian cuisine"
Intent/Goal: "Can you provide a simple and easy to follow recipe"
Response Format (if needed): "Write it as a step by step list?"
Perfect Prompt: 
1. "I'm a beginner cook trying to make Italian cuisine. Can you provide a simple and easy to follow recipe for spaghetti carbonara? Write it as a step by step list"


Context: "I'm a software developer"
Specific Information: "working on a Python project"
Intent/Goal: "Can you explain how to implement exception handling in Python?"
Response Format (if needed): Write it in a simple paragraph or list.

Perfect Prompt: "I'm a software developer working on a Python project. Can you explain how to implement exception handling in Python? Write it in a simple paragraph or list.

Here are the 6 key components that make up the perfect formula for ChatGPT and Google Bard: Task, Context, Exemplars, Persona, Format, and Tone.

In this video we go through real-world examples and demonstrate how each component contributes to the effectiveness of the prompt (aka the better the prompt, the better the output)! 

The Task sentence needs to articulate the end goal and start with an action verb.

Use three guiding questions to help structure relevant and sufficient Context.

Exemplars can drastically improve the quality of the output by giving specific examples for the AI to reference.

For Persona, think of who you would ideally want the AI to be in the given task situation.

Visualizing your desired end result will let you know what format to use in your prompt.

And you can actually use ChatGPT to generate a list of Tone keywords for you to use!
